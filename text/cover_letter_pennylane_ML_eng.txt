Dear Sir or Madam,
Building tools that make people’s lives easier — not more complicated — is why
I became an engineer. Pennylane’s vision of helping entrepreneurs focus on what
truly matters by removing the friction of financial operations speaks directly to
that mission.
With degrees in Data Science and Computer Science from École des Mines de
Saint-Étienne and Seoul National University, I have hands-on experience across
the ML lifecycle, from model development to deployment and monitoring. I
thrive in collaborative, fast-moving environments, and I take pride in writing
clean, reliable systems that scale.
I’m excited by the opportunity to contribute to a product used daily by
thousands of small businesses, in a team that values trust, autonomy, and
technical excellence.
I would welcome the chance to speak further about how I could bring value to
Pennylane’s Machine Learning team.
Yours faithfully,

Julian Paquerot
