Education
2022–2024

Seoul National University, College of Engineering (#40 globally, THE 2025)
M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering

2020–2024 École des Mines de Saint-Étienne
Diplôme d’Ingénieur Civil des Mines (Master’s Degree in Engineering)
⋄ Specialization: Data Science
⋄ Award for Community Engagement

2018–2019 Lycée Carnot de Dijon, Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles
Two-year intensive program in advanced mathematics and physics (MPSI/MP* track)
⋄ Preparation for France’s competitive national entrance exams (concours) to Grandes Écoles
(elite institutions).

Experiences
2022–2024

Graduate Student Researcher, SNU Vision & Learning Lab
⋄ Designed and deployed a domestic AI training framework with reinforcement learning (RL)
environment, including an AI2THOR-based environment for hierarchical tasks (evaluation
overhead reduced to 1.7% of raw runtime).
⋄ Trained 10+ researchers on JAX/Flax workflows, achieving 25% lab-wide adoption within 1
year through seminars and code reviews.
⋄ Teaching Assistant for Discrete Mathematics (150+ undergrads) and Probabilistic Graphical
Models (40+ grad students): Designed and graded final exams, assignments, and led tutorials.

June–Aug. AI Engineer Intern, Apex Solutions
2022 ⋄ Prototyped a multi-agent simulation environment (Python/Gymnasium) for modeling intrusion
scenarios in critical infrastructure; framework remains actively used for internal security
research.
⋄ Developed RL benchmarks for adversarial capture-the-flag simulations with limited informationsharing constraints (PyTorch/Stable-Baselines3).
⋄ Optimized RL algorithms for red team (offense) and blue team (defense) agents, enhancing
adversarial training in security-focused simulations.

2021–2022

Arts Council President, École des Mines de Saint-Étienne
⋄ Led cultural programming for 500+ students, organizing 3+ monthly events (concerts,
exhibitions) and coordinating the annual gala with 100+ artists. Expanded arts engagement
through workshops (music, dance, theater), doubling participation within 1 year.
