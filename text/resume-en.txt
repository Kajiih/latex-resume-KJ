Experience
SNU Vision & Learning Lab

Seoul, South Korea

Graduate Student Researcher
September 2022 – September 2024
• Conducted reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) experiments to enhance quality and alignment of
unsupervised skill discovery in two embodied environments (iTHOR, Crafter). Fully implemented a graphical skill
extraction model in JAX/Flax, achieving a 2–4x increase in training speed. Led lab-wide adoption of JAX, mentoring
other researchers and driving ∼25% adoption within a year.
• Led the design and development of an embodied reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on AI2THOR.
Deployed Docker containers to run Unity simulations on a headless cluster, enabling efficient training of RL agents.
Refined task evaluation algorithms, cutting overhead to 1.7% of the raw simulation runtime. Designed 14 complex RL
tasks, increasing task completion rates by 80% compared to heuristic-based rewards.

Apex Solutions

Figeac, France

Research Internship
June 2022 – August 2022
• Prototyped a multi-agent simulation environment in Python (Gym/Gymnasium) to model intrusion scenarios in
critical infrastructure. Developed a foundational framework still actively used for internal security research.
• Developed RL benchmarks for multi-agent capture-the-flag simulations with realistic limited information-sharing
constraints (PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3). Optimized RL algorithms for red team (penetration) and blue team
(defense) agents in multi-agent scenarios, improving adversarial training in security simulations.

monthly events, including the school’s annual gala featuring over 100 artists. Expanded arts engagement through
regular music, dance, and theater classes, doubling participant numbers over one year.
◦ Sports Coordinator, Cartel des Mines 2022: Directed the logistical and athletic planning of a 4-day
inter-school multi-sport competition (14 sports, 1,800+ participants, $160,000 budget), achieving high participant
satisfaction.
