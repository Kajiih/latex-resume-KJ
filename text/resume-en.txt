Experience
SNU Vision & Learning Lab

Seoul, South Korea

Graduate Student Researcher
September 2022 – September 2024
• Conducted reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) experiments to enhance quality and alignment of
unsupervised skill discovery in two embodied environments (iTHOR, Crafter). Fully implemented a graphical skill
extraction model in JAX/Flax, achieving a 2–4x increase in training speed. Facilitated lab-wide adoption of the JAX
framework by introducing and supporting other researchers in its application, achieving 2̃5% adoption within a year.
• Led the design and development of an embodied reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on AI2THOR
Deployed Docker containers to run Unity-based simulations on a headless cluster, enabling efficient training of RL
agents. Optimized task evaluation algorithms, reducing overhead to 1.7% of the raw AI2THOR simulation runtime.
Designed 14 complex RL tasks, demonstrating 80% relative improvement in task completion with a predicate-based
reward signal.

Apex Solutions

Figeac, France

Research Internship
June 2022 – August 2022
• Initiated the development of a multi-agent environment to simulate intrusion scenarios in critical infrastructure
(Python, Gym/Gymnasium). Delivered a base environment still actively used in subsequent research projects.
• Designed and implemented reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks for multi-agent capture-the-flag simulations with
limited information-sharing constraints (PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3). Adapted RL algorithms for red team
(penetration) and blue team (defense) agents to optimize performance in multi-agent scenarios.

École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Étienne | France

September 2020 – September 2024

Master of Data Science; Diplôme d’Ingénieur Civil des Mines (ICM)
• Relevant Courses: Probability & Statistics, Statistical learning, Machine learning, Metamodeling and Optimization,
Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing, Networks,
• Award for Community Engagement:
◦ President, Arts Council (Bureau des Arts): Directed cultural programming and events, organizing three
monthly events, including the school’s annual gala with over 100 individual artists. Expanded arts engagement
through regular music, dance, and theater classes, doubling participant numbers over one year.
◦ Sports Coordinator, Cartel des Mines 2022: Directed the logistical and athletic planning of a 4-day,
multi-sport competition with over 1,800 participants from top French engineering schools, and $160,000 budget
with high participant satisfaction.
