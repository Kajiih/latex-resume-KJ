Experience
SNU Vision & Learning Lab

Seoul, South Korea

Graduate Student Researcher
September 2022 – September 2024
• Developed and optimized a probabilistic graphical model for unsupervised skill extraction in JAX/Flax using
reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), reducing training costs by 60%. Mentored researchers on
adopting JAX, achieving ∼25% lab-wide adoption within one year.
• Led the design and development of an embodied reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on AI2THOR,
including a framework for creating realistic hierachical tasks. Designed algorithms making the agent evaluation
function tractable, reducing overhead to 1.7% of raw simulation runtime in AI2THOR. Deployed Docker containers to
run Unity simulations on a headless cluster, enabling efficient training of RL agents.

Apex Solutions

Figeac, France

AI Engineer Internship
June 2022 – August 2022
• Prototyped a multi-agent simulation environment in Python (Gym/Gymnasium) to model intrusion scenarios in
critical infrastructure. Deployed a foundational framework still actively used for internal security research.
• Developed RL benchmarks for multi-agent capture-the-flag simulations with realistic limited information-sharing
constraints (PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3). Adapted and optimized RL algorithms for red team (offense) and blue team
(defense) in multi-agent scenarios, enhancing adversarial training in security-focused simulations.

Education

a class of ∼40 students.
◦ Discrete Math (Undergraduate): Designed, administered, and graded a 2-hour final exam and two major
homework assignments for ∼150 students.

École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Étienne | France

September 2020 – September 2024

Master of Data Science; Diplôme d’Ingénieur Civil des Mines (ICM)
• Relevant Courses: Software Engineering Practices, Network, Probability & Statistics, Artificial Intelligence,
Statistical learning, Experimental methods.
• Award for Community Engagement:
◦ President, Arts Council (Bureau des Arts): Directed cultural programming and events, organizing three
monthly events, including the school’s annual gala featuring over 100 artists. Expanded arts engagement through
regular music, dance, and theater classes, doubling participant numbers over one year.
◦ Sports Coordinator, Cartel des Mines 2022: Directed the logistical and athletic planning of a 4-day
inter-school multi-sport competition (14 sports, 1,800+ participants, $160,000 budget), achieving high participant
satisfaction.
