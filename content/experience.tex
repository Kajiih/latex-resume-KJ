\bulletItem{
    Conducted reinforcement learning with human feedback experiments to enhance quality and alignment of unsupervised skill discovery in two embodied environments (iTHOR, Crafter).
    Fully implemented a graphical skill extraction model in JAX/Flax, achieving a 2--4x increase in training speed.
    Facilitated lab-wide adoption of the JAX framework by introducing and supporting other researchers in its application, achieving \~25\% adoption within a year.
}
\bulletItem{
    Led the design and development of an embodied RL environment based on AI2THOR
    Deployed Docker containers to run Unity-based simulations on a headless cluster, enabling efficient training of RL agents.
    Optimized task evaluation algorithms, reducing overhead to 1.7\% of the raw AI2THOR simulation runtime.
    Designed 14 complex RL tasks, demonstrating 80\% relative improvement in task completion with a predicate-based reward signal.
    Paper currently under review for ICRA 2025.

\bulletItem{
    Initiated the development of a multi-agent environment to simulate intrusion scenarios in critical infrastructure (Python, Gym/Gymnasium).
    Delivered a base environment still actively used in subsequent research projects.
}
\bulletItem{
    Designed and implemented reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks for multi-agent capture-the-flag simulations with limited information-sharing constraints (PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3).
    Adapted RL algorithms for red team (penetration) and blue team (defense) agents to optimize performance in multi-agent scenarios.
