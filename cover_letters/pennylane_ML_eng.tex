Building tools that make people’s lives easier — not more complicated — is why I became an engineer. Pennylane’s vision of helping entrepreneurs focus on what truly matters by removing the friction of financial operations speaks directly to that mission.

With degrees in Data Science and Computer Science from École des Mines de Saint-Étienne and Seoul National University, I have hands-on experience across the ML lifecycle, from model development to deployment and monitoring. I thrive in collaborative, fast-moving environments, and I take pride in writing clean, reliable systems that scale.

I’m excited by the opportunity to contribute to a product used daily by thousands of small businesses, in a team that values trust, autonomy, and technical excellence.

I would welcome the chance to speak further about how I could bring value to Pennylane’s Machine Learning team.
