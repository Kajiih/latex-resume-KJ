Building AI systems that are both rigorous and purposeful has been the core of my journey—from developing reinforcement learning environments at Seoul National University to designing open-source tools like RL-THOR that support AI research.

As a recent graduate in AI engineering from Mines Saint-Étienne and Seoul National University, I specialize in machine learning and have a strong interest in natural language processing. At SNU Vision \& Learning Lab, I created a reinforcement learning framework that cut evaluation costs to 1.7\% of runtime. I also led internal adoption of JAX/Flax tooling, now used by a quarter of the lab. I'm proficient in Python's data science ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter, PyTorch), familiar with modern NLP libraries (Hugging Face, Transformers), and have hands-on experience with deep learning.

I thrive in international, multidisciplinary environments that value both precision and collaboration. My curiosity and problem-solving mindset drive me to tackle real-world challenges at scale, and I'm eager to apply these strengths in a production-focused, research-driven team like CFM's.

I'd be excited to contribute to your efforts in exploratory text analysis, predictive modeling, and high-volume data pipelines, and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can support your mission.
