I'm excited to apply for the Python Developer position at Corsearch. My recent work building simulation frameworks and optimizing AI environments has given me strong experience writing clean, scalable Python code and working closely with researchers, engineers, and domain experts to deliver production-ready tools. I thrive in cross-functional teams where technical precision meets real-world impact—just like the mission at Corsearch.

As an AI researcher and Python developer, I focused on performance optimization, reproducible environments (Docker), and collaborative tooling—skills directly aligned with improving and expanding Corsearch’s brand protection platform. I’ve also onboarded teams to new Python-based workflows and contributed to critical debugging and infrastructure improvements, which taught me how to balance rapid iteration with long-term maintainability.

I’m eager to bring that mindset to Corsearch and contribute to a product that protects brands at global scale. Thank you for your time and consideration—I’d love to connect further.
